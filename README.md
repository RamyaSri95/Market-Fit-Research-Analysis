# Market-Fit-Research-Analysis

𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:

To assess the potential for air purifiers in India, a multi-layered analysis was conducted. This included studying AQI patterns, consumer needs, city-wise pollution trends, and existing air purifier features.

**Key Insights**:

High Demand Zones: Cities like Delhi, Gurugram, and Hajipur consistently show poor air quality, indicating a strong product-market fit.
Seasonal Trends: Winter months (Nov-Jan) have the highest AQI, showing seasonal spikes in demand.
Lifestyle Fit: Metro cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Delhi show a high City Risk Score, making them prime targets for health-conscious consumers.
Gap in Current Products: Existing purifiers lack features like real-time AQI display, cost-efficiency, multi-pollutant detection, and low power usage, presenting innovation opportunities.
